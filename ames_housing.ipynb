Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

Higher 'PTRATIO' will have lower house price because parents like their kids to have more attention and care from the teacher.

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "### Learning Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.  \n",

The test score inscreases sharply at first but then flattens out. Having more training points would not benefit the model since it is overfitting now. The model has already fit training data perfectly but failed to generalize to test data."

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_iter'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",

In the case of a *decision tree regressor*, the model has learned *what the best questions to ask about the input data are*, and can respond with a prediction for the **target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown — such as data the model was not trained on."

    "An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on."

Secondly, the features we used here are definitely not enough to describe a home. We'll need more features for an accurate-enough model. Finally, the data were from an urban city like Boston, where there's generally less space for each person. It will not apply to a rural city in the south, for example. "
